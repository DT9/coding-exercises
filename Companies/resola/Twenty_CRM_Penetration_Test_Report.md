{
  "data": {
    "__schema": {
      "queryType": {
        "name": "Query"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Impact:**
- Complete API schema disclosure
- Enables targeted attacks against specific endpoints
- Potential data exfiltration vectors identification
- Business logic discovery

**Remediation:**
- Disable GraphQL introspection in production
- Implement proper authentication for GraphQL endpoints
- Add query complexity limiting
- Implement query depth limiting

### HIGH RISK

#### 2. Missing Critical Security Headers
**CVSS Score:** 7.4 (High)  
**Vulnerability Type:** Security Control Bypass  

**Description:**
The application lacks all critical security headers, leaving it vulnerable to various client-side attacks.

**Missing Headers:**
- `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)
- `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP)
- `X-Frame-Options`
- `X-Content-Type-Options`
- `X-XSS-Protection`
- `Referrer-Policy`
- `Permissions-Policy`

**Impact:**
- Clickjacking attacks possible
- XSS attacks not mitigated
- MIME-type sniffing attacks
- Insecure HTTP downgrade attacks
- Information leakage through referrers

**Remediation:**
```javascript
// Recommended security headers
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      scriptSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      styleSrc: ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https:"]
    }
  },
  hsts: {
    maxAge: 31536000,
    includeSubDomains: true,
    preload: true
  }
}));
```

#### 3. CORS Wildcard Configuration
**CVSS Score:** 7.1 (High)  
**Vulnerability Type:** Access Control Bypass  

**Description:**
The application uses `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, allowing any domain to make requests.

**Evidence:**
```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

**Impact:**
- Cross-origin attacks from malicious websites
- Potential credential theft
- Data exfiltration from authenticated sessions

**Remediation:**
- Implement specific origin whitelist
- Use credentials-aware CORS configuration
- Validate and sanitize origin headers

#### 4. Server Technology Disclosure
**CVSS Score:** 6.9 (High)  
**Vulnerability Type:** Information Disclosure  

**Description:**
Server headers reveal specific technology stack information.

**Evidence:**
```
X-Powered-By: Express
```

**Impact:**
- Technology stack enumeration

GraphQL endpoint provides detailed error messages that could aid attackers.

**Evidence:**
```json
{"errors":[{"message":"Must provide query string."}]}
```

**Impact:**
- API structure disclosure
- Debugging information leakage
- Attack vector identification

**Remediation:**
- Implement custom error handling
- Sanitize error messages in production
- Log detailed errors server-side only

---

### MEDIUM RISK

#### 7. Potential Client-Side Routing Issues
**CVSS Score:** 5.3 (Medium)  
**Vulnerability Type:** Access Control Bypass  

**Description:**
All paths return the same HTML content, suggesting client-side routing that may not enforce server-side access controls.

**Impact:**
- Potential bypass of server-side authorization
- Direct object reference vulnerabilities

## Conclusion

The Twenty CRM application in its current state presents significant security risks that must be addressed before production deployment. The most critical issues involve information disclosure through GraphQL introspection and the complete absence of security headers. 

While the application appears to have basic functionality working correctly, the security implementation requires substantial improvement. The identified vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized access, data theft, and potential system compromise.

**Priority Actions:**
1. Disable GraphQL introspection immediately
2. Implement comprehensive security headers
3. Fix CORS configuration
4. Add proper authentication controls
5. Remove information disclosure vectors

Implementation of these recommendations will significantly improve the security posture of the Twenty CRM application and reduce the risk of successful attacks.
